# Data Indexers

### Overview

Welcome to the Analytics page, a comprehensive hub dedicated to interacting with data services, analytic tooling on zkSync Era. Each guide includes hands-on examples, ensuring that both newcomers and experienced developers can seamlessly harness the power of the analytical tooling within the zkSync Era.

### Covalent

[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/zksync-era/) provides the industry-leading Unified API bringing visibility to billions of Web3 data points. Developers use Covalent to build exciting multi-chain applications like crypto wallets, NFT galleries, and investor dashboard tools utilizing data.

### DipDup

[DipDup](https://dipdup.io/) is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

### Flair

[Flair](https://docs.flair.dev/) offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

### Graph Network

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. The Graph makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly. Use The Graph network today to index protocol data on zkSync!

### Space & Time

[Space and Time](https://www.spaceandtime.io/) is the verifiable compute layer that scales zero-knowledge proofs on a decentralized data warehouse to deliver trustless data processing to smart contracts, LLMs, and enterprises. Space and Time joins indexed blockchain data from major chains with offchain datasets.

### SubQuery Network

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a fast, flexible, and reliable open-source data indexer that provides you with custom APIs for your web3 project across all of our supported chains.
